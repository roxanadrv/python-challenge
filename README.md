#Financial Analysis Projects
This repository contains two Python projects for financial analysis: "PyBank" and "PyPoll." Each project folder includes a Python script, a "Resources" folder for data, and an "analysis" folder for results.

#PyBank
The "PyBank" folder contains a Python script, "main.py," that analyzes financial data from a CSV file and calculates various financial statistics. The results of the analysis are saved in the "analysis" folder.

PyBank contents:
    - main.py: Python script for financial analysis. It calculates and prints the total number of months, net total profit/loss, average change in profit/loss, greatest increase in profits (date and amount), and      
    greatest decrease in profits (date and amount).
    
    - Resources: Contains the CSV dataset, "budget_data.csv," used for analysis.
    
    - analysis: Stores the results of the financial analysis, including a text document with the analysis results.

How to Use
    - Navigate to the "PyBank" folder.
    
    - Open a terminal or command prompt in this folder.
    
    - Run the Python script using the following command:
      python main.py

    - The script will perform the financial analysis and print the results to the terminal. The analysis results are also stored in the "analysis" folder as a text document.



#PyPoll
The "PyPoll" folder contains a Python script, "main.py," that analyzes election data from a CSV file and calculates election statistics. The results of the analysis are saved in the "analysis" folder.

PyPoll contents:
    - main.py: Python script for election analysis. It calculates and prints the total number of votes, lists of candidates with their respective vote counts, the percentage of votes each candidate won, and 
    determines the winner based on popular vote.
    
    - Resources: Contains the CSV dataset, "election_data.csv," used for analysis.
    
    - analysis: Stores the results of the election analysis, including a text document with the analysis results.

How to Use
    - Navigate to the "PyPoll" folder.
    
    - Open a terminal or command prompt in this folder.
    
    - Run the Python script using the following command:
      python main.py
     
    - The script will perform the election analysis and print the results to the terminal. The analysis results are also stored in the "analysis" folder as a text document.
